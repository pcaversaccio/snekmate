## 🙋‍♀️ Opening an Issue

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest a feature, you are welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/issues/new/choose). For serious bugs, please do **not** open an issue, but refer to our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

Before opening an issue, please review the existing open and closed issues as well as the existing [discussions](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/discussions) and consider commenting on one of them instead.

For general types of discussion, e.g. on best practices, formatting, etc., please consider opening a [new discussion](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/discussions/new/choose).

When you propose a new feature, you should provide as much detail as possible, especially on the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritised by their potential impact on the ecosystem, so we value information that shows the impact could be high.

## 🛠 Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

As a contributor, you are expected to fork the `main` branch of this repository, work on your own fork, and then submit pull requests. The pull requests are reviewed and eventually merged into the `main` repository. See ["Fork a repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for how this works.

Ensure you read and follow our [Engineering Guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md). Run prettier, linter, and tests to make sure your PR is sound before submitting it.

When you open a PR, you will be provided with a [template](./.github/pull_request_template.md) and a checklist. Read it carefully and follow the steps accordingly. You can expect a review and feedback from the maintainer [pcaversaccio](https://github.com/pcaversaccio) afterwards.
