## ⚙️ Installation

It is recommended to install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) through the `npm` package manager, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) when you install it on your system. It is recommended to use a Node.js version `>= 16.0.0`.

Once you have `npm` installed, you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

npm install --global yarn
```

After having installed Yarn, simply run:

```

This repository also includes the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolkit. You can simply run `forge install` to install all the submodule dependencies that are in this repository. If you need help getting started with Foundry, we recommend reading the [📖 Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh).
