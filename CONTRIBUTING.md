## 🛠 Creating a Pull Request (PR)

As a contributor, you are expected to fork the `main` branch of this repository, work on your own fork and then submit pull requests. The pull requests are reviewed and eventually merged into the main repository. See ["Fork-a-Repo"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for how this works.

## 🌀 Dependencies

You will need the following dependencies:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)

## ⚙️ Installation

It is recommended to install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) through the `npm` package manager, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) when you install it on your system. It is recommended to use a Node.js version `>= 16.0.0`.

Once you have `npm` installed, you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

After having installed Yarn, simply run:

```bash
yarn install
```

This repository also includes the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolkit. You can simply run `forge install` to install all the submodule dependencies that are in this repository. If you need help getting started with Foundry, we recommend reading the [📖 Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh).
