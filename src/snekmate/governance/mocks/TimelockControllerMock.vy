    @dev Initialises the contract with the following parameters:
           - `minimum_delay_`: The initial minimum delay in seconds
              for operations,
           - `proposers_`: The accounts to be granted proposer and
              canceller roles,
           - `executors_`: The accounts to be granted executor role,
           - `admin_`: The optional account to be granted admin role
              (disable with the zero address).

         IMPORTANT: The optional admin can aid with initial
         configuration of roles after deployment without being
         subject to delay, but this role should be subsequently
         renounced in favor of administration through timelocked
         proposals.

         To omit the opcodes for checking the `msg.value`
         in the creation-time EVM bytecode, the constructor
         is declared as `payable`.
    @param minimum_delay_ The 32-byte minimum delay in seconds
           for operations.
    @param proposers_ The 20-byte array of accounts to be granted
           proposer and canceller roles.
    @param executors_ The 20-byte array of accounts to be granted
           executor role.
    @param admin_ The 20-byte (optional) account to be granted admin
           role.
