@title Multi-Role-Based Timelock Controller Reference Implementation

@author pcaversaccio

@notice This module enables the timelocking of operations by scheduling
        and executing transactions. By leveraging `access_control`, the
        `timelock_controller` contract introduces three roles:
          1. proposer (`PROPOSER_ROLE`),
          2. executor (`EXECUTOR_ROLE`), and
          3. canceller (`CANCELLER_ROLE`).
        The proposer role is responsible for proposing operations, the
        executor role is responsible for executing scheduled proposal(s),
        and the canceller is responsible for cancelling proposal(s). This
        contract is self-administered by default (unless an optional admin
        account is granted at construction), meaning administration tasks
        (e.g. grant or revoke roles) have to go through the timelock process.
        At contract creation time, proposers are granted the proposer and
        canceller roles.

        The proposal(s) must be scheduled with a delay that is greater
        than or equal to the minimum delay `get_minimum_delay`, which can
        be updated via a proposal to itself and is measured in seconds.
        Additionally, proposal(s) can be linked to preceding proposal(s)
        that must be executed before the proposal can be executed.

        Ready proposal(s) can be executed by the executor, who is solely
        responsible for calling the `execute` or `execute_batch` functions.
        Eventually, the proposal(s) can be batched individually or in batches.
        The latter is useful for processes that have to be executed in the
        same block.

        Please note that the `timelock_controller` contract is able to receive
        and transfer ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens.

        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol.
