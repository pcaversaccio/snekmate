@author pcaversaccio
@notice Signature verification helper functions that can be used
        instead of {ecdsa-_recover_sig} to seamlessly support both
        ECDSA secp256k1-based (see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1)
        signatures from externally-owned accounts (EOAs) as well as
        EIP-1271 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signatures
        from smart contract wallets like Argent and Safe. For strict
        EIP-1271 verification, i.e. only valid EIP-1271 signatures are
        verified, the function `_is_valid_ERC1271_signature_now` can
        be called. The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's
        implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/SignatureChecker.sol.
@custom:security Signatures must not be used as unique identifiers since the
                 `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique)
                 signatures (see EIP-2: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2)
                 or signatures can be malleablised using EIP-2098:
                 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098.
