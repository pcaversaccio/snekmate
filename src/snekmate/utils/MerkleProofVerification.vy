@notice The Merkle tree and the corresponding proofs can be generated
        using the following JavaScript libraries:
        - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree (recommended),
        - https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs (deprecated).
        If you are using the (deprecated) JavaScript library `merkletreej`
        (https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs), you must select
        `keccak256` as the hashing algorithm and pair sorting should
        be enabled. You should avoid using 64-byte leaf values before
        hashing or using a hash function other than `keccak256` for
        hashing leaves. The reason for this is that the concatenation
        of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be
        reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library
        `merkle-tree` (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree)
        generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of
        the box. You will find a quick start guide in the README.
        OpenZeppelin provides some good examples of how to construct
        Merkle tree proofs correctly:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.test.js.
        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol.
