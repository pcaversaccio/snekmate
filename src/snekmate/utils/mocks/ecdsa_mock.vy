    @notice WARNING: This function is vulnerable to a kind of
            signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098
            compact signatures in addition to the traditional
            65-byte signature format. The potentially affected
            contracts are those that implement signature reuse
            or replay protection by marking the signature itself
            as used rather than the signed message or a nonce
            included in it. A user may take a signature that has
            already been submitted, submit it again in a different
            form, and bypass this protection. Also, see OpenZeppelin's
            security advisory for more information:
            https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h.
