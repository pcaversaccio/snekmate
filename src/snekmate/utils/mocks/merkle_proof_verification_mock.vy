    @param proof The 32-byte array containing sibling hashes

           Merkle tree.
    @param proof_flags The Boolean array of flags indicating

           branches) or an element from the `proof` array is used
           to calculate the next hash.

    @custom:security It's crucial to recognise that the condition where
                     `((root == proof[0]) and (len(leaves) == 0))` is
                     effectively treated as a no-op in {mp-_process_multi_proof}
                     (i.e. it simply returns `proof[0]`) and is thus
                     regarded as a valid multiproof. However, if you are
                     not validating the leaves in another part of your
                     code, you may want to consider disallowing this case.
