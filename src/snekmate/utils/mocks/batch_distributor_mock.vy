    @dev Distributes ERC-20 tokens, denominated in their corresponding
         lowest unit, to a predefined batch of recipient addresses.
    @notice To deal with (potentially) non-compliant ERC-20 tokens that do have
            no return value, we use the kwarg `default_return_value` for external
            calls. This function was introduced in Vyper version `0.3.4`. For more
            details see:
            - https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2839,

            - https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca.
            Note: Since we cast the token address into the official ERC-20 interface,
            the use of non-compliant ERC-20 tokens is prevented by design. Nevertheless,
            we keep this guardrail for security reasons.
    @param token The ERC-20 compatible (i.e. ERC-777 is also
           viable) token contract address.
    @param data Nested struct object that contains an array
           of tuples that contain each a recipient address &
           token amount.
