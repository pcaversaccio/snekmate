@notice These functions can be used to implement a basic access
        control mechanism, where there is an account (an owner)
        that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
        This extension to the {ownable} contract includes a two-step
        ownership transfer mechanism where the new owner must call
        `accept_ownership` to replace the old one. This can help
        avoid common mistakes, such as ownership transfers to incorrect
        accounts or to contracts that are unable to interact with
        the permission system. By default, the owner account will
        be the one that deploys the contract. This can later be
        changed with `transfer_ownership` and `accept_ownership`.
        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol.
