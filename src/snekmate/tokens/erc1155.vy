        - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155.
        In addition, the following functions have
        been added for convenience:
        - `uri` (`external` `view` function),
        - `set_uri` (`external` function),
        - `total_supply` (`external` `view` function),
        - `exists` (`external` `view` function),
        - `burn` (`external` function),
        - `burn_batch` (`external` function),
        - `is_minter` (`external` `view` function),
        - `safe_mint` (`external` function),
        - `safe_mint_batch` (`external` function),
        - `set_minter` (`external` function),
        - `owner` (`external` `view` function),
        - `transfer_ownership` (`external` function),
        - `renounce_ownership` (`external` function),
        - `_check_on_erc1155_received` (`internal` function),

        - `_before_token_transfer` (`internal` function),
        - `_after_token_transfer` (`internal` function).
        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's implementation here:
