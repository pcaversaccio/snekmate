@notice The ERC-2981 introduces a standardised way to retrieve
        royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
        to enable universal support for royalty payments across
        all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants. The ERC-165
        identifier for this interface is `0x2A55205A`. For more
        details, please refer to:
