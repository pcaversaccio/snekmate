@notice These functions can be used to implement a basic access
        control mechanism, where there is an account (an owner)
        that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
        By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys
        the contract. This can later be changed with `transfer_ownership`.
        An exemplary integration can be found in the ERC-20 implementation here:
        https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20.vy.
        The implementation is inspired by OpenZeppelin's implementation here:
        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol.
